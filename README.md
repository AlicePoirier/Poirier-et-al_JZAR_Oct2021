Abstract:
Mammals deposit odorant signals during social interactions, and for marking territories and resources. Odorants may be direct by-products of essential biochemical pathways, derived from the diet and the environment, and/or produced by commensal bacteria. Accordingly, animals in captivity, which are provisioned with artificial diets and environments, may produce a different range of odorants than found in their wild counterparts. Few studies have compared chemosignalling in wild and captive conspecifics. We begin to address this gap by investigating the effect of captivity on chemosignalling in the bearded emperor tamarin, Saguinus imperator subgrisescens. We found that scent samples collected from eight wild tamarins and analyzed by headspace solid-phase microextraction–gas chromatography-mass spectrometry contained over twice the number of identified odorants as those collected from five captive tamarins. Wild and captive scent samples also showed a marked overall difference in their chemical composition. These results suggest that captivity alters primate chemosignalling, with potential implications for captive husbandry practices, including conservation breeding programs of rare species.
